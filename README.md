# Package-Installation

# 🧰 My Scientific Software Stack

This repository documents the key scientific software packages, tools, and libraries I’ve used across various projects — especially those with non-trivial or messy installation procedures. It serves both as a personal reference and as a guide for others working on similar problems.

## 📦 Overview

The packages covered here include tools for:

- Gravitational wave data analysis (e.g. `LALSuite`, `Bilby`)
- Numerical computing and scientific visualization (in future, if needed)
- Symbolic and functional programming (in future, if needed)
- Data fitting, modeling, and simulation (in future, if needed)

Each folder or section will contain:

- Installation instructions (especially if manual steps or patches are needed)
- Environment setup (`environment.yml`, `requirements.txt`, or `Project.toml`)
- Notes on compatibility and system-specific issues
- Example usage or test scripts
